    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Research Assistant</b>, Amirkabir University of Technology, Iran, 2023–2025<br>
        During my thesis research at the FACTS laboratory, I collaborated closely with graduate and doctoral
        students, focusing on optimizing the use of Mobile Battery Energy Storage Systems (MBESS) within microgrids.
        I developed and tested a novel multi-objective optimization framework using meta-heuristic algorithms to
        efficiently manage MBESS placement and operational performance in a 33-bus distribution network. The results
        demonstrated that MBESS not only reduced operational costs and power losses, but also significantly improved
        voltage stability compared to traditional fixed storage systems. A key innovation in my research was the
        integration of autonomous electric trucks for battery transport, which was analyzed alongside the uncertainties
        of renewable energy sources and load variations.

        <b>Internship</b>, Regional Electricity Company of Mazandaran Province, Iran, 2019<br>
        During a three-month internship, I had the opportunity to learn about various types of transformers, cables,
        and low-voltage lines. Additionally, I gained practical experience using AutoCAD software, where I was instructed
        in wiring and positioning electric poles, as well as creating drawings for optimal power transmission.

        <b>During my master’s courses</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Power System Dynamics 1</b><br>
            This course covered classical and modern power system stability and control, including compensator design
            (lead, lag, lead–lag, PID), root-locus and frequency-response methods, and dynamic modeling of power system
            components. The first project involved identification and nonlinear modeling of a separately excited DC
            generator in MATLAB/Simulink, including parameter extraction via lab-style tests and PID-based speed/voltage
            control design. The second project focused on modeling, testing, and controlling a synchronous machine,
            including open-circuit, short-circuit, frequency-response, and transient experiments, followed by designing
            AVR and governor controllers around linearized models. Both systems were validated through simulation using
            step responses, operating-point linearization, and closed-loop performance analysis. These projects
            demonstrated strong skills in dynamic system modeling, control design, and MATLAB/Simulink implementation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>FACTS</b><br>
            This course covered the fundamentals and advanced concepts of FACTS devices, including power semiconductor
            equipment, voltage-source converters, shunt compensation (SVC/TCR/TSC), series compensation, and combined
            FACTS controllers. The project focused on modeling and analyzing a Static Var Compensator (SVC) connected to
            a transmission system using PSCAD. A two-source 13.8 kV transmission line was simulated, and the SVC’s
            TCR/TSC–based reactive power control was implemented using a dynamic firing-angle and capacitor-switching
            controller. The control system regulated bus voltage through PI-based modulation, filtering stages, and
            coordinated switching logic. Simulation results demonstrated fast transient response, voltage regulation to
            1 p.u., and stable steady-state performance of the compensator.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Distributed Generation (DG)</b><br>
            This course covered fundamental and applied topics in DG, including renewable energy sources, microturbines,
            PV systems, fuel cells, DG integration in distribution networks, optimal DG placement, and power-electronics
            interfaces. The project focused on designing a hybrid DG supply system for a residential villa using HOMER
            software. Solar PV, wind turbines, diesel generators, storage systems, and economic parameters were modeled
            based on real local resource data. System performance was evaluated through simulation, optimization, and
            sensitivity analysis (inflation rate and project duration). The final configuration was selected based on
            minimum NPC and reliable supply in both grid-connected and island modes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Power System Utilization</b><br>
            This course covered advanced power system topics including impedance matrix formulation (direct/indirect
            methods), multi-machine stability, economic operation, optimal power flow, system security, load–frequency
            control, AVR, and reactive power/voltage stability. The course project focused on optimal energy scheduling
            in a microgrid using a hybrid PSO–ANN method. The IEEE-14 bus test system was modeled and simulated in
            MATLAB/Simulink, incorporating real data such as load profiles, electricity prices, and weather conditions.
            The ANN was trained using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm, while PSO optimized hidden-layer neurons and
            learning rate. Results showed that the proposed PSO–ANN significantly improved scheduling accuracy and
            reduced MAE compared to conventional BPSO.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Optimization in Electrical Power</b><br>
            This course covered fundamental and advanced optimization concepts—linear and nonlinear programming,
            convexity, KKT conditions, economic dispatch, unit commitment, and optimal power flow. The project focused on
            Economic Dispatch using Linear Programming (EDLP), where quadratic generator cost curves were segmented and
            linearized in MATLAB. An LP model was formulated using segment-based marginal costs, equality/inequality
            constraints, and generator operating limits. The optimization was solved using MATLAB’s <code>linprog</code>
            function, and results included optimal generation allocation and total system cost, verified against 850 MW
            demand. The project demonstrated proficiency in mathematical modeling, cost-function linearization, and
            practical implementation of power system optimization.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Management of Conventional and Smart Distribution Systems</b><br>
            This course covered key topics in modern distribution network management, including load and harmonic
            forecasting, loss reduction, DG integration and voltage control, conservative voltage reduction, EV power
            management, demand-side management, reliability assessment, and smart metering/communication infrastructures.
            The course project focused on multi-objective decentralized energy management in unbalanced smart distribution
            networks, implemented on the IEEE-13 bus system. PV, WT, DG, MT, BESS, and DR programs were modeled under
            stochastic uncertainties using Monte-Carlo scenario generation and reduction. A GA-based optimization
            framework was developed to minimize losses, voltage deviation, emissions, and operating costs simultaneously.
            Simulations (24-hour operation) showed up to 80% cost reduction, 23% loss reduction, and major voltage-profile
            improvements compared to the base case.
